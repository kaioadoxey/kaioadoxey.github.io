                        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
                            <p>
                                The purpose of this website is to allow people in a wide variety of ages and professions to check the weather, for the day, easily and quickly before they leave their home. This way my clients will feel prepared to meet the day. I also want people to be able to save their cities or areas that they want to view the weather in. this way they can feel up to date and informed about the weather throughout the places they travel. 
                            </p>
                        <h2>Audience</h2>
                            <p>
                                The target audience consists of men and women ages 18-55, middle income in North America. I think that this web site is marketing to adults who are both students and professionals, or anyone who would like to check the weather quickly. This website will meet the needs of the target audience because it has quick and easy access to many types of weather alerts and conditions. Basic weather information appears immediately upon opening the site and offers many detailed updates from others frames and drop downs. The clean and clear website makes it accessible and appealing to this wide demographic. Visiting the site will be more enjoyable because, if you are in their target demographic, you can get all the information you need without feeling like it is a major task. Easy access drop down menus allow you to navigate to where you want to be and make browsing through information easy, all at the top of the page. However, if you just wanted to see what the weather in your saved locations, you could just scroll down the main page. It will be a good site to visit because you won’t feel hindered as you are navigating through the site through any medium.

                    <h2>Wire Fame Sketches</h2>
                        <h3>Initial Design</h3>
                            <p>
                                These are some of the initial wire frame designs that I have sketched to represent what I would like my site to look like.
                            </p>
                        <h4>Small Screen</h4>

                            <img alt="medium screen wire frame" src="/kaioadoxey.github.io/images/medium_initial.JPG">
                        <h4>Large Screen</h4>
                        <img alt="large screen wire frame" src="/kaioadoxey.github.io/images/large_initial.JPG">
                    </section>
                    <section id = "revission_&_peer_review">
                        <h2>Peer Review</h2>
                            <p>I was able to have Wyatt peer review my original wire frames and this is what he said:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                “I really am a fan of the layout of your weather website, especially your desktop version. I understand you orientated the desktop version sideways on the paper because websites are typically wider than they are tall these days, I like that. I like the positioning of all your separate boxes of information and the location of your search bar. The only issue I have is how busy your mobile phone site is, it feels like trying to squeeze a desktop amount of information on a tiny screen. But I feel that if you are clever in spacing those three middle columns from each other then it could be pulled off, but if too much content is put in each column, it could get a little squished. Maybe remove a column or move it below? Other than that I like the direction your site is going, a versatile site like weather.com that provides all sorts of different information to the user.”
                            </p>
                        <h3>Revised Design</h3>
                        <h4>Small Screen</h4>
                            <img alt="revised small wire frame" src="/kaioadoxey.github.io/images/small_revised.JPG">
                            <p>
                                After reading what Wyatt had to say about my wire frames, I decided that this small screen needed the most revision. I took his advice and I decided that simpler was better. so I cut out the image, because I thought it was not really necessary, then I made the important content bigger and allowed for links to further content that people may want to see. Overall I think that this is a clearer design. I think that people will be able to interpret the content quicker and easier. 
                            </p>
                        <h4>Medium Screen</h4>
                            <img alt="revised medium wire frame" src="/kaioadoxey.github.io/images/medium_revised.JPG">
                            <p>
                                On the medium screen I decided that I would go with the new theme of simple. So the first thing that I did was get rid of the image. I figured that if it was that important to me I could make a link to it later. Then I made the important content bigger so that it would be clearer and easier to read. 
                            </p>
                        <h4>Large Screen</h4>
                            <img alt="revised large wire frame" src="/kaioadoxey.github.io/images/large_revised.JPG">
                            <p>
                                I realize that what I had was ok. However, I felt like I could make it better, and clearer, so I changed the links at the top, and moved the location search to a more relevant place where it would be easier to see. Then I divided the rest of the space to make the content that is most important to my target audience big and easy to interpret.
