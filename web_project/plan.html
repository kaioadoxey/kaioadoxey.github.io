                <h2 class="hedings">Audience</h2>
                <p class="reg">My audience is a select group of individuals that are caught up in the trend of organically grown, and produced food. Though I am not selling food, I plan to market a new kind of clothing along the same moral outline that these people portray. This quote I feel portrays the mind set I am trying to sell to.</p>
                <p class="reg">“He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.” <br>― Immanuel Kant</p>
                <p class="reg"> So I will be marketing clothing from organically feed, free range, and well cared for llamas. Buying the products sold here will be marketed in a way that shows that you are supporting these llamas way of life. The more products that are sold from the fur of a specific llama the more the owners can justify treating the llamas with such luxury.</p>
                <p class="reg">My audience wants to support the lifestyle of these llamas. They feel it is a moral need of to improve the lives of domestic animals. They will be able to start with buy the products displayed on my site. </p>
