                    <h2>History of Llama Fur</h2>
                <p class="reg">Llama fur is getting a lot more attention these days, now that people are starting to notice how it tends to outperform other fibers like wool and synthetics. And why shouldn’t it? Llama fleece has been around for millennia — even the ancient Incan kings recognized the llama’s unique qualities and reserved the “fiber of the gods” for use by only the wealthy and influential.</p>
                <p class="reg">But less is known about the proper care and cleaning of llama garments. Although llama clothing can last for years, too many people ruin their llama garments — or shy away from buying them in the first place — simply because they don’t know how to clean and care for them. Fortunately, you don’t have to be one of them. Read on to learn all about llama and keep your garments silky and soft for years to come!</p>

                    <h2>Why Llama Fur</h2>
                <p class="reg">Llama is a breed apart when it comes to natural fibers. Stronger, softer, lighter, and warmer than either merino wool or cashmere, it’s a natural choice for winter clothing and accessories. It’s also resistant to pilling and won’t shrink if proper care is given, making it possible to keep your llama clothing for years, even decades!</p>
                <p class="reg">Llama fleece is famous for its luxurious softness and doesn’t scratch or “prickle” the skin like wool products. It’s also hypoallergenic since it doesn’t contain lanolin, an oil generated by sheep that can cause sensitivity in people with dermatological disorders.</p>
                <p class="reg">As if silkiness and versatility weren’t enough, llama makes highly wear-resistant garments: its strength reduces stretching and distortion, and grease and oil don’t spot llama as easily as they do other fibers. Due to llama’s water-resistant properties, you can simply blot away any spills. And the nature of the fiber reduces static electricity, which attracts dust and soil.</p>

                    <h2>Washing Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a clean sink or tub with cold water and a small amount of mild liquid detergent like baby shampoo or a fine fibers formula. (Using hot water, or even two different temperatures of water, will “shock” the fibers, making them mat together and start turning into felt.) Do not use chlorine bleach or even gentle Woolite, as these harsh cleaners will cause damage.</li>
                    <li>Soak the garment for 3 to 5 minutes, gently squeezing the suds through the garment. Avoid twisting, wringing, scrubbing, or otherwise agitating it, as this will cause felting. Dyed garments will have some chance of bleed, but since llama fiber takes dyeing better than most other fibers, this shouldn’t be a problem after the first wash.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the garment twice in clean, cold water and gently squeeze out the excess. Be gentle handling it to avoid wrinkles and distortion.</li>
                    <li>Lay the garment between two towels, roll up the towels and set it aside for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place the garment on a dry towel or sweater rack and reshape (do not hang to dry). Let it dry away from sunlight and direct heat.</li>
                    <li>If the garment is wrinkled after drying, you can steam it lightly with an iron, or simply hang it up in the bathroom, run the shower, and let the steam ease away the creases.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t have the time to hand-wash your llama garments, you can always take them to a professional dry-cleaner. Bring along any labels or care tags that came with the garment, and be sure to point out any spots and stains so they can use the best method to remove them.</li>
                </ol>

                    <h2>Storing Llama Fur Products</h2>
                <p class="reg">Llama clothing can last for decades, but its greatest enemies are moths and other pests that cause damage during storage. (Although certain dogs have been known to love the scent of llama!) If you need to put your llama away during warmer months, give it a good clean first following the instructions above — pests are drawn to dirt and body oils on fibers.</p>
                <p class="reg">You can keep pests away from any garment by storing it in a chest of inspect-repelling Spanish cedar, or by placing cedar chips in the storage area. To keep away moths, use lavender bundles (although chemical moth balls will do as well).</p>
                <p class="reg">A shirt box, clean pillow case, clean paper bag, or cardboard box will keep the air circulating around the garment. Never use plastic or dry cleaning bags for your llama, as this will cause moisture to build up and the fibers will felt. And like any other knit garment, llama clothing should be folded rather than hung to prevent stretching and distortion.</p>
