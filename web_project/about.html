                    <h2 class="hedings">O.L.P.'s Purpose</h2>
                <p class="reg">Our purpose is to improve the lives of domestic animals. All of our llamas our fed with the very best organically grown, and produced food. We believe the statement said by Immanuel Kant:</p>
                <p class="reg">“He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.” </p>
                <p class="reg"> So, all of our clothing is made from organically feed, free range, and well cared for llamas. Buying the products sold here will be marketed in a way that shows that you are supporting these llamas way of life. The more products that are sold from the fur of a specific llama the more the owners can justify treating the llamas with such luxury.</p>
                <p class="reg">If you desire to support the lifestyle of these llamas, and you feel a moral need to improve the lives of domestic animals. Then you can start by buying the products here at O.L.P. In doing this you will not only get a high quality product, but you will also receive the satisfaction of knowing you helped improve the life of an animal here on earth. </p>

                    <p class="reg">Steve enjoys long walks in the pasture, along with a good bowl of organically grown vegetables. Steve just had a baby this year so he also enjoys spending time with his daughter Sue, and wife Meredith. Steve is particularly good at the high jump. He demonstrates his skills daily by jumping over the fences to get to whatever organically grown food he can get his hoofs on. Steve is also the most skilled of all our llamas at spitting. He can spit nearly 25 feet, if brought to the occasion. </p>

                    <p class="reg">Edna enjoys making fun of the other farm animals by exaggerating their behavior. She is particularly good at imitating the farm dog Max. However, Max doesn’t appreciate her behavior and demonstrates his displeasure with a vocal complaint to the source. Edna is our fluffiest llama. She grows her fur almost twice as fast as any of our other llamas. She also has a son Teena who she spends most of her time with. </p>
