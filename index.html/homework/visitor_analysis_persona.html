				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <h3>Target audience </h3>
				<p>The target audience consists of men and women ages 18-34 middling income in North America. I think that this web site is marketing to adults who are both students and young professionals, who like to exercise socially. I think that this web site meets these needs because it shows many pictures of young adults exercising socially. Many athletes that are idols of this age demographic are pictured here using Under Armour gear. Athletes from basketball stars to professional ballet dancers show that the content is modern and popular. You can This made the visiting the site enjoyable because if you are in their target demographic you feel reassured that the stuff you buy here is both high quality and good looking enough for the professionals.  Easy access drop down menus allow you to navigate to where you want to be and make browsing through merchandise easy, all at the top of the page. However if you just wanted to see what was new for men and women both simply scroll down and you can find the newest additions to the Under Armour brand. I think that this represented a good mobile site to visit because you don’t feel hindered as you were navigating through the site. I did not find myself wishing that I had a computer to browse the content of this site.</p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                In this web site I feel like they knew who their target audiences is but they don’t know how to present their information in a way that is appealing to them. It looks like they are trying to attract, and/or provide information for, companies, or individuals that own commercial, or residential buildings to be renovated. However, I do believe that the information that they presented is in a format that is easy to find, and it is presented clearly. However there is information that may be good to have on this website, such as credential, references, current/recent projects, etc. Nevertheless the information that is present is easy to find with the navigation buttons on the left hand side. I think that the worse part about this site is that it was not designed to be viewed on a mobile devise.  My phone simply looked like a really small desktop screen when viewing this website.
